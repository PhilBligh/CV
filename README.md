## Phil Bligh
After 14 years filming and editing news stories for the BBC all over the UK and abroad, I started to feel the need to challenge myself. I discovered coding and found an immediate affinity for it, enjoying the problem-solving and puzzle-like logic. I took the bold moove of leaving a dream job to throw myself into the world of development, learning all I could from every source available. 

I am ridiculously proud to say I am now a Junior Full Stack Web Developer, recently graduated from the world-renowned Makers Academy 16-week developer course. I am well-versed in Ruby, Rails, Sinatra, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Express, React, and several testing libraries. I am also a certified Scrum Master, and I'm ready for whatever you want to throw at me.
